# Social Media Live Chat Targeted Advertising Bot

A Python-based bot designed for targeted advertising on social media live chat platforms like Twitch, TikTok Live, Facebook Live, and YouTube Live. This bot monitors live chat messages in real-time, analyzes user conversations for topics related to credit repair and financial services using OpenAI's GPT-4, and delivers personalized content to users based on their specific queries.

# Features

Real-Time Chat Monitoring: Connects to live chat channels and tracks user messages as they occur.
Intelligent Content Analysis: Utilizes GPT-4 to analyze chat messages for relevance to predefined frequently asked questions (FAQs) about credit repair and financial topics.
Personalized Ad Delivery: Sends targeted video links directly to users who express interest or need in specific financial services.
Command-Based Interaction: Supports the !ask command, allowing users to ask questions and receive AI-generated responses.
Multi-Platform Compatibility: Easily adaptable to various live chat platforms beyond Twitch.

# How It Works

Connection: The bot connects to specified Twitch channels using TwitchIO.
Monitoring: It continuously monitors and collects chat messages in real-time.
FAQ Similarity Check: When a message is detected, the bot checks if it's similar to any of the predefined FAQs using GPT-4.

# Engagement:

If a message is similar to an FAQ, the bot responds by sending a targeted YouTube video link to the user.
If a user uses the !ask command followed by a question, the bot provides an AI-generated response using GPT-4.
Customization: The list of FAQs and the video link can be customized to fit different marketing goals.

# Code Overview
    Dependencies
    Python 3.x
    OpenAI API: For GPT-4 language processing.
    TwitchIO: For connecting and interacting with Twitch chat.
    
# Main Components

  # API Keys Configuration: Set your Twitch and OpenAI API keys.

      TWITCH_TOKEN = 'TWITCH_TOKEN'
      TWITCH_CLIENT_ID = 'TWITCH_CLIENT_ID'
      OPENAI_API_KEY = 'OPENAI_API_KEY'

  # FAQ List and Video Link: Define the FAQs and the video link to be shared.

      faq_list = [
          "What is a good credit score?",
          "How do I get good credit?",
          "What credit do I need for a loan?",
          "How do I remove negative items from my credit report?"
      ]
      video_link = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YourVideoLink"

  # Similarity Check Function: Uses GPT-4 to determine if a message is similar to any FAQ.
    
      def is_similar_to_faq(message):
          # GPT-4 API call to check similarity

  # GPT-4 Response Function: Generates a response for the !ask command.

      def get_gpt4_response(prompt):
          # GPT-4 API call to generate a response

  # Bot Class: Inherits from commands.Bot in TwitchIO.

      event_ready: Prints a login confirmation.
      event_message: Handles incoming messages, checks for FAQ similarity, and processes the !ask command.
      class Bot(commands.Bot):
          async def event_ready(self):
              # Code when the bot is ready
      
          async def event_message(self, message):
              # Code to handle incoming messages

  # Bot Execution: Initializes and runs the bot.
